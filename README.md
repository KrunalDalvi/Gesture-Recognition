# Gesture-Recognition
The Gesture Recognition is an innovative application that enhances user interaction with computers and laptops by enabling control of brightness and volume through hand gestures detected via the device's webcam. Developed using Python, the project harnesses the power of computer vision, a subfield of AI, to accurately interpret and respond to hand movements in real-time. By eliminating the need for physical input devices, this project offers a seamless and intuitive way to interact with computing devices, further bridging the gap between humans and technology.

# Required Libraries
1) Numpy: A library for numerical computing and array manipulation in Python.
2) CV2 (OpenCV): A library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
3) Mediapipe: A cross-platform framework for building multimodal applied machine learning pipelines.
4) Math: Provides mathematical functions defined by the C standard.
5) PIL (Python Imaging Library): A library for adding image processing capabilities to Python (commonly used through its fork, Pillow).
6) tkinter: A GUI toolkit for Python.
7) os: Provides a portable way of interacting with the operating system.
8) Time: Provides various time-related functions.
